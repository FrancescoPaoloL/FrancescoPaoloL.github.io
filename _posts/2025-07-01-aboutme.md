## About Me

Software Engineer Senior Analyst with 6+ years at Fincons Group, currently allocated to Swiss financial services. I work on KTLO operations maintaining business-critical .NET applications (Framework and Core), managing Docker/Kubernetes environments, and troubleshooting production systems using AppDynamics, Dynatrace, and Splunk.

Beyond my day job, I'm studying the fundamentals: working through K&R's *The C Programming Language* to understand low-level systems, diving into Machine Learning math and algorithms, and building projects on Kaggle and GitHub. Long-term goal: move from maintaining systems to building intelligent ones.

Based in Bari, Italy. 16+ years total development experience (including freelance work before 2019).
